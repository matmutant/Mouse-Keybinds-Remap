# m505-Remap
Automated remaping script for Logitech m505 mouse : changing buttons layout/behavior


This script switches between two or more mapping for your unifying Logitech device
##Making it work:
You need to manually edit the device name, since i couldn't automate this command:
  to know your current mapping use >xev< command, for your device list use >xinput list<
  To add an option, just add a new "elif"

this has been done for M505, but should work for others
